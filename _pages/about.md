I'm a grad student in AI/ML at ASU. I've experienced how to design and develop, train, and deploy models in deep learning, statistics, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. It is easily forgettable that we are running into death from birth. This blog is about reflections, insights, thoughts, and  realizations, based on my experience. Happy to be criticized to be mature.
