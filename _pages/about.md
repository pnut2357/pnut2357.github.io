## About This Blog

> *"It is easily forgettable that we are running into death from birth."*

This blog is my space for **reflections**, **technical deep-dives**, and **lessons learned** from 8+ years in the trenches of production ML. I share what I wish I had known earlier — the failures, the wins, and everything in between.

**Topics I write about:**
- 🧠 LLM fine-tuning & prompt engineering
- 🔧 MLOps best practices & war stories
- 📊 System design for ML at scale
- 💡 Career advice for ML engineers

*Happy to be criticized to mature. Iron sharpens iron.*
