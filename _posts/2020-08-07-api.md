# Introduction
An API (Application programmable Interface) is, in simple words, to help interactions between multiple softwares. It is an easy-to-use tool like GUI or UI.
Think of the case that you want to order a delivery food. You choose a restaurant, check the menu, and decided chicken tacos. You can clicked on your mobile and 20 minutes later the food came to your place. Even though you don't have the ingredients, but you can easily get it. That menu is the API, your order is the API call, the food delivered to your place is response. ingredients you get are delivered from suppose that you are a farmer and want to sell your products to

## Clients and Servers
The client-server relationship comes when your device is connected to the internet. For instance, your mobile/laptop (client) connected to your wifi/mobile network (server). Technically, Servers are the computers that store webpages, sites, or apps such that a webpage can be shown in the user's web browser.

You can imagine that from your home (client) to the shop you need to visit (server) you need to pass through:
- Internet Connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web like the street between your home and the shop.
- TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet like the transportation that let you place how you approach to the shop.
- DNS: Domain Name Servers are like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's real address (the IP address of the shop you want to visit). The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place.
- HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to communicate to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.
- Component files: If a website were a store, a component file would be a product in a store. A website (store) contains various  component files (products). These files are mainly in two types:
  1. Code files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), etc, like structure or frames to format a website.
  2. Assets: images, music, video, Word documents, PDFs, etc, like a design of style and contents for a website.
