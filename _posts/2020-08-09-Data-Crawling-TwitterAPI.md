# Introduction
In the earlier post, I briefly introduced about how API and web work. In this post, let me talk about the practical usage of API: data crawling using Twitter API.

## Get Consumer Key (API key) and Access Key (Access token)

If you want access to Twitterâ€™s APIs, you should create a twitter account (if you don't have one) and apply for a developer account using the new developer portal at [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/en).

If you want a help for steps in order to prevent to be banned, I recommend this [youtube instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlvtqp44xoQ)

Then, you should see Apps when you place your cursor on the account (right top corner in the figure shown below).

From your Twitter Apps page, click `+ create App` and you are ready to go.

## Open Source Libraries
The following libararies are open-source Python libraries for accessing Twitter API. I personally started with `tweepy`.
- python-twitter by the Python-Twitter Developers
- tweepy by the tweepy Developers
- twitter by the Python Twitter Tools developer team
- TwitterSearch by @ckoepp
- twython by @ryanmcgrath and @mikehelmick
- TwitterAPI by @geduldig

# Practice
## Save Consumer Key and Access Key

The following code is secrete.py file that I separately saved Consumer Key and Access Key.

```python
# API key == consumer_key
consumer_key = "???"
# API secret key == consumer_secrets
consumer_secret =  "???"
# Access token == access_key
access_key = "???"
# Access token secret == access_secret
access_secret = "???"
```
#Practice1: World Sentiment Comparison (Superman vs. Batman)
Practice1 is to see how live twitters think about two keywords. The program captures the real-time tweets related to two keywords that you can set up. In this time, let's compare Superman with Batman.

## Streaming
First, I imported the necessary libraries and set the credentials (Consumer Key and Access Key).
> consumer_key (variable) is set as API key and access_key (variable) is set as Access token. Consumer API keys and Access token & access token secret) to authenticate with the API:

```python
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob
import preprocessor as prep
import statistics
from typing import List
from secrets import consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key, access_secret
# Authentication:
auth= tweepy.AppAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)
```

'get_tweets()' is to stream the 10 live tweets related to the 'keyword' you will set, 'clean_tweets()' is to clean the parsed tweets that contain non-alphabetical characters, 'get_sentiment()' is to measure and return the score of argument 'tweets', and 'generate_average_sentiment_score()' is to generate the average scores of two keywords for comparison

```python
def get_tweets(keyword: str) -> List[str]:
    all_tweets=[]
    for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search, q=keyword, tweet_mode='extended', lang='en').items(10):
        all_tweets.append(tweet.full_text)
    return all_tweets

def clean_tweets(all_tweets: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    tweets_clean=[]
    for tweet in all_tweets:
        tweets_clean.append(prep.clean(tweet))
    return tweets_clean

def get_sentiment(all_tweets: List[str]) -> List[float]:
    sentiment_scores=[]
    for tweet in all_tweets:
        blob = TextBlob(tweet)
        sentiment_scores.append(blob.sentiment.polarity)
    return sentiment_scores

def generate_average_sentiment_score(keyword: str) -> int:
    tweets = get_tweets(keyword)
    tweets_clean = clean_tweets(tweets)
    sentiment_scores = get_sentiment(tweets_clean)
    average_score = statistics.mean(sentiment_scores)
    return average_score
```

The main started with asking two keywords to check which keyword the live twitters prefer. I inserted 'superman' and 'batman' to compare.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('What does the world prefer?')
    first_thing = input()
    print('...or...')
    second_thing = input()
    print()
    first_score = generate_average_sentiment_score(first_thing)
    second_score = generate_average_sentiment_score(second_thing)
    if (first_score > second_score):
        print(f'the humanity prefers {first_thing} over {second_thing}!')
    else:
        print(f'the humanity prefers {second_thing} over {first_thing}')

```
As the result shows, the live twitters, at the moment, prefer batman to superman.

    What does the world prefer?

     superman

    ...or...

     batman

    the humanity prefers batman over superman

Let's go further how accurately TextBlob classifies positive, negative, and neutral on each text. That is called Sentiment Analysis. using the function 'get_tweets()', I saved all the live tweets in variable 'tweets'.

```python
tweets = get_tweets('superman')
tweets
```
The following tweets shows the live tweets on the first keyword 'superman' at that moment.

    ['RT @CristianT__T: The Best #superman ðŸ§¤ðŸ§¤ https://t.co/UmXiDDQ4c4',
     '@DanSlott WATCHMEN\nPERSEPOLIS\nMAUS\nBATMAN YEAR ONE\nX-MEN GOD LOVES, MAN KILLS\nSECRET WARS\nIDENTITY CRISIS\nBATMAN BLACK MIRROR\nSPIDER-MAN SAGA OF THE ALIEN COSTUME\nALL-STAR SUPERMAN',
     '@FeathersandFoes I chose Superman on purpose. His stories are usually uplifting and pretty positive. If you get a chance, the first story arc post Infinite Crisis (one year later) is amazing.',
     '@DanSlott Dark Pheonix\nAll Star Superman\nSuperman: Secret Identity\nMister Miracle',
     '@cieItae the return of superman',
     "RT @Mister_Walsh: Watching Superman: The Movie as I draw today and it's got me itching for a new Supes movies that is full of hope and lighâ€¦",
     'RT @DrPopCultureBG: Great Moments in Villainy\n\n#Superman https://t.co/c3kiDO213F',
     '@AdamTGorham @Mister_Walsh Frankly itâ€™s the only parts of Snyderâ€™s Superman I like. The flying scene in the arctic with soaring score. \n\nThen the rest happened.',
     'Great Moments in Villainy\n\n#Superman https://t.co/c3kiDO213F',
     'My superman T-shirt for for me on my birthday by my sweet little strawberry pie cup I love you dear https://t.co/GCrjm5nz69']

Next step was to clean the tweets, using the function 'clean_tweets()' and save cleaned tweets in variable 'tweets_clean'.

```python
tweets_clean=clean_tweets(tweets)
tweets_clean
```

The following cleaned tweets are shown.

    [': The Best',
     'WATCHMENPERSEPOLISMAUSBATMAN YEAR ONEX-MEN GOD LOVES, MAN KILLSSECRET WARSIDENTITY CRISISBATMAN BLACK MIRRORSPIDER-MAN SAGA OF THE ALIEN COSTUMEALL-STAR SUPERMAN',
     'I chose Superman on purpose. His stories are usually uplifting and pretty positive. If you get a chance, the first story arc post Infinite Crisis (one year later) is amazing.',
     'Dark PheonixAll Star SupermanSuperman: Secret IdentityMister Miracle',
     'the return of superman',
     ": Watching Superman: The Movie as I draw today and it's got me itching for a new Supes movies that is full of hope and ligh",
     ': Great Moments in Villainy',
     'Frankly its the only parts of Snyders Superman I like. The flying scene in the arctic with soaring score. Then the rest happened.',
     'Great Moments in Villainy',
     'My superman T-shirt for for me on my birthday by my sweet little strawberry pie cup I love you dear']

Can you see the 9th tweet 'Great Moments in Villainy'? What do you think of its classification, positive or negative? Let's check how the function get_sentiment() classifies it.

```python
sentiment_scores = get_sentiment(tweets_clean)
sentiment_scores
```
    [1.0,
    -0.20833333333333331,
    0.17954545454545456,
    -0.275,
    0.0,
    0.24318181818181817,
    0.8,
    0.0,
    0.8,
    0.22083333333333333]

The score goes from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). That tells how each tweeter feel on the keyword 'superman'. The 9th tweet 'Great Moments in Villainy' was scored 0.8, which means that the tweeter feeled extremely positive on 'superman' at that time. However, (s)he actually talks about 'villainy', not 'superman'. Now, we know that it is misclassified. Practice2 will show performance of sentiment analysis between TextBlob and NLTK Vader. I chose these two packages because they are fast and accurate enough for a tremendous amount of text data.

#Practice2: Twitter Data Crawling and Visualizing (Trump)
