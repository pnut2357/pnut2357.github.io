# Lyrics

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind

And some kind of madness has started to evolve,

And I, I tried so hard to let you go

But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light

And I have finally realized what you mean

And now, I need to know - is this real love

Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?

And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had

Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

And now I have finally seen the light

And I have finally realized what you need

But now I have finally seen the end

(finally seen the end)

And I'm not expecting you to care, no

(expecting you to care)

That I have finally seen the light

(finally seen the light)

And I have finally realized

(realized)

I need to love

I need to love

Come to me, just in a dream

Come on and rescue me

Yes I know I can be wrong

Maybe, you're too headstrong

Our love is madness
