## Introduction

Why machine learning? Many industry companies use machine learning to be specialized and differentiated by intelligent applications. For instance, early days, Amazon disrupted the retail market by introducing product recommendations to their website, Google disrupted the advertising market by targeting the new customers who have similar behaviors to the existing customers, and Uber disrupted the taxi industry by optimizing how to connect drivers with customers in real time. Such tech made their products special.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

ML pipeline is simply to train a model. Machine learning pipelines iteratively improves the current model that you created for a better output. Data proliferation tremendously affect your decision-making valued or misvalued, depending on your approach and data manipulation.

Every data is not labeled: mostly unlabeled. ML method (algorithm) is based on your goal and the data type. Under the 3 categories (Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning), the 'method' including learning process varies. The following figure and table may clearly show what they are and when to use.
